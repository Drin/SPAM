# Overview
This project, SPAM - Suite of Pyroprint Analysis Methods, was the
implementation backing my M.S. work. Lots of work to be done here to clean it
up, eventually, just to see how much better I can make it (and because it is
pretty terribad).

# TODO
* clean up code (lots of this)
* sift through com/ and src/ directories to see which one I should use as a
  base for refactoring/re-coding
